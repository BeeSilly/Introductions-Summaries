 Usually it is install, and java -version will return the version information

Set environemt path in Ubuntu

 * echo $PATH ==> return all the environment paths
 * export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" ==> temporary put the path into the environment
To make the change permanent, you need to define the $PATH variable in the shell configuration files. In most Linux distributions when you start a new session, environment variables are read from the following files:
Global shell specific configuration files such as /etc/environment and /etc/profile. Use this file if you want the new directory to be added to all system users $PATH.
Per-user shell specific configuration files. For example, if you are using Bash, you can set the $PATH variable in the ~/.bashrc file. If you are using Zsh the file name is ~/.zshrc.
In this example, weâ€™ll set the variable in the ~/.bashrc file. Open the file with your text editor and add the following line at the end of it:
nano ~/.bashrc
~/.bashrc
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
Save the file and load the new $PATH into the current shell session using the source command:
source ~/.bashrc
To confirm that the directory was successfully added, print the value of your $PATH by typing:
echo $PATH
 * /etc/environment ==> PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/usr/local/hadoop/bin"
 
Modify the hostname
hostnamectl ==> check the current local host name.
vim etc/hosts ==> 127.0.0.1 localhost <your hostname>
